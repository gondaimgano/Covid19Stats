# Covid19Stats


## About Covid 19 Statistics

The main purpose of the app is to help you the user to see how COVID 19 is scattered around the world via a MapKit and by providing you with updated information using the POSTMAN API and able to offline save the information via CoreData

### Visual Look of the App

### Fast results

Flutter is fast. It's powered by the same hardware-accelerated 2D graphics
library that underpins Chrome and Android: [Skia]. We architected Flutter to
support glitch-free, jank-free graphics at the native speed of your device.
Flutter code is powered by the world-class [Dart platform], which enables
compilation to 32-bit and 64-bit ARM machine code for iOS and Android, as well
as JavaScript for the web and Intel x64 for desktop devices.

### Productive development

Flutter offers stateful hot reload, allowing you to make changes to your code
and see the results instantly without restarting your app or losing its state.

### Extensible and open model

Flutter works with any development tool (or none at all) but includes editor
plug-ins for both [Visual Studio Code] and [IntelliJ / Android Studio]. Flutter
provides [thousands of packages][Flutter packages] to speed your development,
regardless of your target platform. And accessing other native code is easy,
with support for both [FFI] and [platform-specific APIs][platform channels].

Flutter is a fully open-source project, and we welcome contributions.
Information on how to get started can be found at our
[contributor guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
